a massive multiplayer game, in record
time. The EVE Online server cluster runs over 25,000 simultaneous
players in a shared space simulation, most of which is created in
Python. The flexibilities of Python have enabled us to quickly improve
the game experience based on player feedback,&amp;quot; said
Hilmar Veigar Petursson of &lt;a class="reference" href="http://www.ccpgames.com/"&gt;CCP Games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>HomeGain</title><description>&lt;!--utf-8--&gt;&lt;!--0.4--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;HomeGain maintains its commitment to continual improvement through
rapid turnaround of new features and enhancements.  Python supports
this short time-to-market philosophy with concise, clear syntax and a
powerful standard library.  New development proceeds rapidly, and
maintenance of existing code is straightforward and fast,&amp;quot; said Geoff
Gerrietts, Software Engineer, &lt;a class="reference" href="http://HomeGain.com"&gt;HomeGain.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>Thawte Consulting</title><description>&lt;!--utf-8--&gt;&lt;!--0.4--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Python makes us extremely productive, and makes
maintaining a large and rapidly evolving codebase relatively
simple,&amp;quot; said Mark Shuttleworth.&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>University of Maryland</title><description>&lt;!--utf-8--&gt;&lt;!--0.4--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have the students learn Python in our undergraduate and graduate
Semantic Web courses.  Why?  Because basically there's nothing else
with the flexibility and as many web libraries,&amp;quot; said Prof. James
A. Hendler.&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>EZTrip.com</title><description>&lt;!--utf-8--&gt;&lt;!--0.4--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The travel industry is made up of a myriad supplier data feeds all of
which are proprietary in some way and are constantly changing.   Python
repeatedly has allowed us to access, build and test our in-house
communications with hundreds of travel suppliers around the world in a
matter of days rather then the months it would have taken using other
languages.  Since adopting Python 2 years ago, Python has provided us
with a measurable productivity gain that allows us to stay competitive
in the online travel space,&amp;quot; said Michael Engelhart, CTO of
&lt;a class="reference" href="http://www.eztrip.com"&gt;EZTrip.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>RealEstateAgent.com</title><description>&lt;!--utf-8--&gt;&lt;!--0.4--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Python in conjunction with PHP has repeatedly allowed us to develop
fast and proficient applications that permit &lt;a class="reference" href="http://www.realestateagent.com"&gt;Real Estate Agent .com&lt;/a&gt; to operate with minimal
resources. Python is a critical part of our dynamically growing
cluster directory of real estate agents.&amp;quot; said Gadi Hus, Webmaster,
&lt;a class="reference" href="http://www.volico.com/"&gt;Volico Web Consulting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>Firaxis Games</title><description>&lt;!--utf-8--&gt;&lt;!--0.4--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Like XML, scripting was extremely useful as both a mod tool and an
internal development tool.  If you don't have any need to expose code
and algorithms in a simple and safe way to others, you can argue that
providing a scripting language is not worth the effort.  However, if
you do have that need, as we did, scripting is a no brainer, and it
makes complete sense to use a powerful, documented, cross-platform
standard such as Python.&amp;quot;  -- Mustafa Thamer of Firaxis Games, talking
about Civilization IV.  Quoted on page 18 of the August 2005
&lt;a class="reference" href="http://www.gdmag.com/"&gt;Game Developer Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>Firaxis Games</title><description>&lt;!--utf-8--&gt;&lt;!--0.4--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Python, like many good technologies, soon spreads virally throughout
your development team and finds its way into all sorts of applications
and tools.  In other words, Python begins to feel like a big hammer and
coding tasks look like nails.&amp;quot;
-- Mustafa Thamer of Firaxis Games, talking about Civilization IV.
Quoted on page 18 of the August 2005 &lt;a class="reference" href="http://www.gdmag.com/"&gt;Game Developer Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>Firaxis Games</title><description>&lt;!--utf-8--&gt;&lt;!--0.4--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We chose to use python because we wanted a well-supported scripting
language that could extend our core code. Indeed, we wrote much more
code in python than we were expecting, including all in-game screens
and the main interface. It was a huge win for the project because
writing code in a language with garbage collection simply goes faster
than writing code in C++. The fact that users will be able to easily
mod the interface is a nice plus as well. The downside of python was
that it significantly increased our build times, mostly from linking
with Boost.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Soren Johnson, lead designer, Civilization IV.  Quoted
in &lt;a class="reference" href="http://games.slashdot.org/games/05/10/27/059220.shtml?tid=206&amp;amp;tid=11"&gt;a Slashdot interview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
