language as you can have without running into functionality problems.  I

"Like XML, scripting was extremely useful as both a mod tool and an
internal development tool.  If you don't have any need to expose code
and algorithms in a simple and safe way to others, you can argue that
providing a scripting language is not worth the effort.  However, if
you do have that need, as we did, scripting is a no brainer, and it
makes complete sense to use a powerful, documented, cross-platform
standard such as Python."  -- Mustafa Thamer of Firaxis Games, talking

"We chose to use python because we wanted a well-supported scripting
language that could extend our core code. Indeed, we wrote much more
code in python than we were expecting, including all in-game screens
and the main interface. It was a huge win for the project because
writing code in a language with garbage collection simply goes faster
than writing code in C++. The fact that users will be able to easily
mod the interface is a nice plus as well. The downside of python was
that it significantly increased our build times, mostly from linking
with Boost."

We knew we needed a software load balancer to meet a customer commitment to have their site up and running.

We had this hacked-together version that somebody had written in Perl
in a week, but it fell over continuously. And we needed something that
we could put together that would replace it but that also would be
maintainable over the long run.

Since then, we've changed how we use Python a ton internally.
We have lots more production software written in Python. We've
basically reimplemented all our production service monitoring in
Python and also our production software management infrastructure for
a significant amount of what we run.
