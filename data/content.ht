**Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be
used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support
for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive
standard libraries, and can be learned in a few days. Many Python
programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the language
encourages the development of higher quality, more maintainable code.**

Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, OS/2, Amiga, Palm
Handhelds, and Nokia mobile phones. Python has also been ported to the
Java and .NET virtual machines.

Python is distributed under an OSI-approved `open source license
</psf/license>`__ that makes it free to use, even for commercial
products. 

The `Python Software Foundation (PSF) </psf>`__ holds and protects the
intellectual property rights behind Python, underwrites the `PyCon
conference <http://pycon.org/>`__, and funds grants and other projects
in the Python community.
